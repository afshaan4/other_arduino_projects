# Arduino Projects
The code for Arduino projects, made to be used in a Arduino course.
These projects range from blinking an LED to making robots and weather stations.

Wiring guides and full explanations are [here](https://aaalearn.mystagingwebsite.com/2018/03/arduino-camp/) and [here](https://aaalearn.mystagingwebsite.com/2018/04/arduino-summer-camp-middle-school/)

### Using it:
* Install the Arduino IDE, you can use [this guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-arduino-ide).

**If you have Git**

* Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/afshaan4/other_arduino_projects.git`

* Install these libraries by cloning them into the `Arduino/libraries` folder:

 * [LiquidCrystal](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/LiquidCrystal)
 * [DHT sensor library](https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library)
 * [BMP180 library](https://github.com/sparkfun/BMP180_Breakout_Arduino_Library)

**If you don't have Git**

* Download this repository as a zip.
* Extract it wherever you want.

* Download the libraries as zips from here:

 * [LiquidCrystal](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/LiquidCrystal)
 * [DHT sensor library](https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library)
 * [BMP180 library](https://github.com/sparkfun/BMP180_Breakout_Arduino_Library)

* Extract the libraries into the *Arduino/libraries* folder.

* Upload the code to your Arduino using the Arduino IDE, if you need help reference the guide linked above.
